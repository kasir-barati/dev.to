# TIL

Snippet-sized notes that aren't worth a full article. Files under `articles/TIL/**` are intentionally not published to dev.to: the workflow globs `articles/*.md` non-recursively (see `.github/workflows/publish.yml` and `scripts/publish_scheduler.py`).

## Workflow

1. Open an issue with `status/idea` when something catches my attention.
2. While digging in, flip the label to `status/researching`.
3. Once it's worth keeping, write a markdown file under the matching category here and label the issue `status/seed`.
4. If it grows into a full article, move the content to `articles/<slug>.md` and flip the issue to `status/article-wip`. Close on merge.

## File convention

- Filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-kebab-slug.md`.
- No YAML frontmatter. dev.to metadata belongs only on published articles.
- End the body with a `source:` line (URL, book, command output) and an optional `related:` line referencing issues or other TIL files.

## Example

```markdown
# STS AssumeRole default TTL is one hour

Omitting `DurationSeconds` on `sts:AssumeRole` gives a 3600s session. The upper bound is the role's `MaxSessionDuration`, but the default stays at 1h until you ask for more.

source: aws cli `help assume-role`, verified locally related: #42
